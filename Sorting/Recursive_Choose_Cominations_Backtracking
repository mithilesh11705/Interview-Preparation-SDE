An array of integers (possibly with duplicates).

An integer k.

Goal:

Generate all distinct combinations of length k where order does not matter in position, but duplicates are allowed as distinct elements if their positions are different.

🔍 Example:

Edit
Input:  nums = {2, 3, 4}, k = 2
Output: 
{2, 3}
{2, 4}
{3, 4}

Input:  nums = {1, 2, 1}, k = 2
Output:
{1, 2}
{1, 1}
{2, 1}
⚠️ Note:

{1, 2} and {2, 1} are different (if position matters → permutations), or

{1, 2} and {2, 1} are same (if combinations are sorted internally).

But since the output has both {1, 2} and {2, 1}, it seems you're asking for distinct combinations based on actual selection positions, not value-sorted combinations. So order matters — use backtracking without automatic sorting.

🛠️ Approaches
✅ 1. Backtracking with Set for Deduplication
We'll:

Use backtracking to build combinations of length k.

Use a set of vectors to store unique combinations.

Alternatively, use set<string> or sort inside to normalize.

✅ C++ Code (Backtracking with Set)
cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

void backtrack(vector<int>& nums, int k, int start, vector<int>& current, set<vector<int>>& result) {
    if (current.size() == k) {
        result.insert(current); // Set ensures uniqueness
        return;
    }

    for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        current.push_back(nums[i]);
        backtrack(nums, k, i + 1, current, result);
        current.pop_back();
    }
}

vector<vector<int>> findDistinctCombinations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    set<vector<int>> resultSet;
    vector<int> current;
    backtrack(nums, k, 0, current, resultSet);

    return vector<vector<int>>(resultSet.begin(), resultSet.end());
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums1 = {2, 3, 4};
    int k1 = 2;

    vector<int> nums2 = {1, 2, 1};
    int k2 = 2;

    auto print = [](const vector<vector<int>>& res) {
        for (const auto& comb : res) {
            cout << "{ ";
            for (int x : comb) cout << x << " ";
            cout << "}" << endl;
        }
        cout << endl;
    };

    cout << "Output for {2, 3, 4}, k = 2:" << endl;
    print(findDistinctCombinations(nums1, k1));

    cout << "Output for {1, 2, 1}, k = 2:" << endl;
    print(findDistinctCombinations(nums2, k2));

    return 0;
}

Output for {2, 3, 4}, k = 2:
{ 2 3 }
{ 2 4 }
{ 3 4 }

Output for {1, 2, 1}, k = 2:
{ 1 1 }
{ 1 2 }
{ 2 1 }
🧠 Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(2^n) in worst case due to recursive tree.

Space: O(k) for call stack + O(N choose k) for result storage.

🔄 Variants You May Be Asked
Variant	Description	Solution
Subsets of size k	Generate all k-sized subsets	Similar, backtracking
Permutations of k	Order matters	Use backtracking with visited[]
No duplicates	Sort input + skip same values	Use i > start && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]

Would you like:

Version with repetitions allowed (choose same index again)?

Version where order doesn’t matter ({1,2} and {2,1} are same)?

Sure! Let’s walk through the recursive backtracking approach to generate all distinct combinations of size k from a given array. This is one of the most important recursion patterns in interviews and OAs.

🔁 Recursive Backtracking: Core Idea
We want to explore all possible combinations of elements in the array, picking exactly k elements in each combination.

We recursively build a combination:

At each recursive step, we choose or skip an element.

Once the combination reaches length k, we save it.

We then backtrack (i.e., undo the last choice) and try other paths.

🧠 Base + Recursive Case
cpp
Copy
Edit
void backtrack(...):
    if current.size() == k:
        save current
        return

    for i = start to end:
        add nums[i] to current
        backtrack(..., i + 1, ...)
        remove last added number (backtrack)
We increment the index (start = i + 1) so we don’t reuse the same index.

If the array has duplicates and you want distinct value sets, you use a set or skip duplicate values with logic.

📘 Example: nums = {2, 3, 4}, k = 2
Let’s walk through it step by step.

Start with: []

Choose 2:
  → [2]
    Choose 3:
      → [2, 3] ✅ (save)
    Choose 4:
      → [2, 4] ✅ (save)

Choose 3:
  → [3]
    Choose 4:
      → [3, 4] ✅ (save)

Choose 4:
  → [4] (no more elements left to add) ❌
Final Output:

{2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}
✅ Code with Explanation Inline


void backtrack(vector<int>& nums, int k, int start, vector<int>& current, set<vector<int>>& result) {
    // ✅ Base case: If current combination is of size k
    if (current.size() == k) {
        result.insert(current);
        return;
    }

    // 🔁 Recursive case: Try all elements from `start` to end
    for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        current.push_back(nums[i]);             // Choose
        backtrack(nums, k, i + 1, current, result); // Explore
        current.pop_back();                     // Un-choose (Backtrack)
    }
}


💬 Why start = i + 1?
Because:

It avoids using the same element multiple times.

It ensures elements after index i are considered next (maintains combination order).

Prevents duplicates like {2,3} and {3,2} appearing together.

🔁 Backtracking Flow (Dry Run)
For nums = {1, 2, 1}, k = 2:

Step-by-step Flow:
current = []

Pick 1 → current = [1]

Pick 2 → [1,2] ✅

Pick 1 → [1,1] ✅

Backtrack

Pick 2 → current = [2]

Pick 1 → [2,1] ✅

Note: Without a set, you'd get {1,2} and {2,1} both (considered different), or duplicates like {1,1} more than once.

📌 Summary of Recursive Approach
Part	What it Does
Base Case	Stops when length == k
For Loop	Explores each element from current start index
Push	Chooses an element for current combination
Recursion	Moves to next depth level with new start = i+1
Pop	Undoes choice and tries next path
