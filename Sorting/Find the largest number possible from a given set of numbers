Simply sorting the array in descending order and considering the sorted order is not possible here as the sorted array {75, 68, 21, 12, 10, 7} will result in the number 75682112107, which is less than the largest number possible 77568211210.

 The idea is to write our custom comparator function for the sorting routine. For two numbers, X and Y, the custom comparator function will not compare X and Y with each other, but it compares XY with YX, and the greater number will come first in sorted order. Here, XY denotes a number formed by appending Y to X, and YX denotes a number formed by appending X to Y. For example, for X = 15 and Y = 4, XY = 154 and YX = 415.

As evident from the above example, X > Y but XY < YX, so the comparator function will consider Y > X. This is demonstrated below in C, C++, and Java:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
 
// sort using a custom function object
struct {
    bool operator()(int a, int b) const
    {
        string value1 = to_string(a) + to_string(b);
        string value2 = to_string(b) + to_string(a);
 
        return value1 > value2;
    }
} customCompare;
 
string findLargestNumber(vector<int> &nums)
{
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), customCompare);
    string s;
    for (int &i: nums) {
        s += to_string(i);
    }
    return s;
}
 
int main()
{
    vector<int> numbers = { 10, 68, 97, 9, 21, 12 };
 
    cout << "The largest number is " << findLargestNumber(numbers) << endl;
 
    return 0;
}
