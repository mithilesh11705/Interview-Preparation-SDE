 // Anticlockwise rotation by d elements
 ðŸ§  Concept

To rotate an array counter-clockwise by d, you can use the reversal algorithm.

Steps:

Reverse the first d elements.
Reverse the remaining n - d elements.
Reverse the entire array.


ðŸ§  Concept

To rotate clockwise by d positions (i.e., right rotation):

Reverse the entire array.
Reverse the first d elements.
Reverse the remaining n - d elements.

This works symmetrically to the counter-clockwise version.
